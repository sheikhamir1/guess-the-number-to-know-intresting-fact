"Guess the Number" is a classic and simple guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly chosen number within a predefined range. The game typically proceeds as follows:

Initialization: The game selects a random number within a specified range, such as between 1 and 100.

Player's Turn: The player is prompted to input a guess for the chosen number. The player can enter their guess through a user interface, such as a text input field or a series of buttons.

Feedback: After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player to indicate whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. This feedback helps the player refine their subsequent guesses.

Repetition: The player continues to guess until they correctly identify the chosen number. Alternatively, the game may impose a limit on the number of guesses allowed.

End of Game: Once the player guesses the correct number, the game congratulates the player on their success and may display additional information, such as the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.

"Guess the Number" is a straightforward and engaging game that challenges players' logic and intuition while providing immediate feedback on their guesses. It's often used as a fun and educational exercise in programming tutorials to demonstrate concepts such as random number generation, user input, and conditional statements.
